INTRODUCTION

SingOutStrong Karaoke Player is a free, open source music player, with a pitch detection and display feature similar to that of SingStar like games. 
Our goal is to create an easy to use and versitile player for practicing singing skills.

This code documenation may not be too elaborate at the moment, but it should give you a rough idea about what's what.

BUILDING

The project was created in QtCreator 2.5 with Qt 4.8.0. The simplest way to build is to open the included .pro files in QtCreator.
